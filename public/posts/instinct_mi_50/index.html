The outer shroud is held on by 6 small screws. When removed, the shroud can be pulled off the card by slightly wiggling it from side to side. Underneath, the card consists of a long black heat sink spanning the whole length of the card. The GPU die is cooled by a copper vapor chamber, easily recognized by its silver fins.\nThe vapor chamber can be pulled off the die by removing the 4 screws holding it down onto the die. They are the screws which are screw into the silver springy thing on the backside.\nOne particular thing about this card is AMD’s choice of TIM (Thermal Interface Material) between the cooler and GPU die. AMD uses a graphite pad, which is almost impossible to remove in one piece. It is sometimes strongly advised to not use regular thermal paste and instead just reuse the old pad. The pad is supposed to be better at filling in the microimperfections in the cooler and the die. I have repasted most of my MI50’s with Noctua NT-H2 thermal paste and have not encountered any issues so far.\nTo remove the black heatsink, the backplate has to be taken off first, since it covers some hidden screws that are securing the aformentioned heat sink. After all of them have been removed, the heatsink can be pried off the PCB. Note that the thermal pads over the VRMs should be removed with, such that they can be reused. If you need to replace them, I have found that 2 mm thick thermal pads work pretty well.\nDriver/ROCM Install The MI50s are currently running inside the GIGABYTE G292-Z00 server. It’s a great server that has ample cooling capacity for these datacenter GPUs. However, it is operating at jet engine noise levels. For the operating system, Ubuntu Server 24.04.02 LTS was chosen based on two main points:\nUbuntu is a ROCm supported OS, something which is very important when you’re playing with hardware that is not 100% supported. This does not just apply to the MI50’s, but also to Chelsio NICs (blog post coming soon …), the GIGABYTE server, etc.\nUbuntu is the standard OS when it comes to AI and Deep Learning frameworks and applications.\nI can happily report, that the Ubuntu installation has been flawless so far and has caused very little headaches. The same cannot be said about the ROCm/Driver install, which took about 4 attempts to get running smoothly.\nAt the time of writing, the latest ROCm version is 6.4.3. For this project I chose to install version 6.3.0, since AMD decided to drop support for the MI50’s completely beginning with version 6.4.0.\nTo install ROCm, AMD provides a quick install, which in theory should be as easy as one copy-paste. However, I did not have great luck with it, instead resorting to the detailed installation. This is the preferred method for most people. I won’t go over every step of the installation, you can refer to AMD’s detailed instructions. 1\nI’m just sharing the eventual command, which installs ROCm and additional libraries. I strongly recommend to reading through all the options under amdgpu-install --list-usecases and selecting the one’s that you need.\nIssues Another interesting quirk of this card is that it still features a beeper on the PCB. Yes, the kind that is usually found on motherboards. The utility of it on a GPU is still not that clear to me.\nI first noticed this when turning on my Gigabyte G292-Z00, thinking that the noise must be the result of an error message given by the server. But after checking the IPMI and running some tests on the GPU, no errors could be found. All GPUs were running as expected. After investigating and removing one of the four Instinct MI50’s, the noise suddenly stopped. So, I installed the “faulty” card in another motherboard and was greeted by the same friendly beeping. At this point, I thought it must be relatively clear, especially as the card in question was the only one that I took apart to repaste, that the card must have some defect, which however does not impact its functionality. I took the card apart once again and cleaned it even more. (It should be noted that I got this particular card at a reduced price since it was very beat up.) Unable to find the true cause, I just removed the card from the server and put it on the shelf. In the meantime, another MI50 developed similar behavior, but which stopped after a day or two. While browsing the LevelOneTechs forum a week later, I stumbled upon a thread covering the same issue, with one user suggesting that insufficient power may be the cause.2 I’m not able to verify this at the moment, but it does not seem unlikely, considering that on some cards the beeping is only temporary.\nAppendix 0 Flashing VGPUBIOS In recent years a couple different versions of MI50s have surfaced. There is the authentic MI50 by AMD, recognized as Radeon Instinct MI50 16GB. The other type is a chinese model, which seems to be a Radeon VII that has been modified to look like a Radeon Instinct card. In software, they are easily distinguished, as the chinese version is recognized as Radeon VII. There is also a 32 GB variant of the card, making it basically a MI60 that also seems to be coming out of China. However, I do not own one of those cards.\nIn the following part, I am going to show how to flash the VGPUBIOS of a “fake” Instinct MI50 to a real one. Most of this info is from a blog post on a forum about Mersenne primes.3 The required tool is easily obtainable from this GitHub repo.\nFirst, we list all installed GPUs with sudo ./amdvbflash -i.\nAMDVBFLASH version 4.71, Copyright (c) 2020 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. adapter seg bn dn dID asic flash romsize test bios p/n ======= ==== == == ==== =============== ============== ======= ==== ================ 0 0000 07 00 66A1 Vega20 GD25Q80C 100000 pass 113-D1631400-X11 1 0000 45 00 66AF Vega20 GD25Q80C 100000 pass 113-D3600200-105 2 0000 8A 00 66A1 Vega20 GD25Q80C 100000 pass 113-D1631400-X11 3 0000 C6 00 66A1 Vega20 GD25Q80C 100000 pass 113-D1631400-X11 The two versions of the 16 GB MI50 can be distinguished by different device IDs (dID). 66A1 points to the genuine cards, while 66AF belongs to the chinese version.\nI obtained the VBIOS by just copying it out of a genuine MI50 (e.g. adapter 0). By running sudo ./amdvbflash -biosfileinfo bios.rom.0 we get a detailed overview of the VBIOS file.\nAMDVBFLASH version 4.71, Copyright (c) 2020 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.
