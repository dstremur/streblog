## Introduction

## TL;dr

## Installation

## Setup

Contrary to [this post](https://forums.servethehome.com/index.php?threads/cisco-nexus-92160yc-x-350-48xsfp28-6xqsfp-4xqsfp28.45423/post-448115) 
on the ServeTheHome forum, I had no issues installing 10GBase-T transceivers in the SFP28 Slots.
Overall, I had great hardware support with the only non-compatible optics being the Intel CWDM 2km which just refused to work.
